# FocuserParts

In this repository I am maintaining files and other information that describe how the focuser has been built.

For designing and 3d printing of the gear-wheels I have been using this configurator, which directly provides the files that can be opened in Cura. I have been printing the parts with an Anycubic (MEGA) printer and PLA filament.

The belt is a T2.5 145mm (6mm width).

As a controller I am using a Pololu T825 stepper controller. See TicFocuser repository for guidance on the software.
